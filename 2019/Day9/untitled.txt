Treat memory as a dictionary - 
    Key = Memory Address
    Value = Large Number (Long may be too short) - Aparently python handles this natively
        May need to make a large number class to handle this
        Or inport a large number class bc i don't want to write my own multiply

Read in program to list
Turn list to dictionary

When reading memory:
    if not index in mem:
        mem[index] = 0
    return mem[index]
    
When writing memory:
    mem[index] = value
